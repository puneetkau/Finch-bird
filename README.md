# Finch-bird

Project Description/Design Choices:
In this project, me and my partner Francesca programmed a Finch robot to do a little dance and print a message. We incorporated sound, lighting, text, and movement in our program. We made sure to use multiple methods and structures throughout our code. We also used a for loop to repeat the dance.

Challenges/Solutions:
The hardest part of this program was the setup. We didn't really know how to w0ork the github application and install all the extensions. It didn't work on my computer at all. This meant we had to complete everything on Francesca's computer. We also asked Mr. Aiello for help. It was also hard to navigate the files through the terminal. However, after we set it up it got pretty easy. We couldn't access the README file, though, which is why we are writing it out.

Future Enhancements:
We could have made it dance through the maze. We wanted our dance to be longer and have more steps but most of our time went towards the setup. We also could have had more with the lights or a longer song.
